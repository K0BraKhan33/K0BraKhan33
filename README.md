**KwaiMaiMai (A Recipe App)**  
This project was developed using Agile methodologies, with a team of 10 creating a full-stack JavaScript recipe app using Next.js and NoSQL.  
**Role:** Junior Full Stack JavaScript Engineer  
**Tasks:** Worked with APIs, server-side rendering, local components, sorting systems, manifest and service worker for offline use, and utilized MongoDB to create an interactable API for data storage and use. Acted as week one team lead, reporting to my and my team's coach about issues and conducting daily standups to keep the team updated and plan accordingly.

Used to interrogate how we as a team could handle back-to-back weeks of nonstop pressure and changes. From a fullstack Next.js React project with in-team Team Leads, but added pressure of new work stacked on by the new week.
